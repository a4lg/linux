This series implements a generic framework to parse multi-letter ISA
extensions. This series is based on Tsukasa's v3 isa extension improvement
series[1]. I have fixed few bugs and improved comments from that series
(PATCH1-3). I have not used PATCH 4 from that series as we are not using
ISA extension versioning as of now. We can add that later if required.

PATCH 4 allows the probing of multi-letter extensions via a macro.
It continues to use the common isa extensions between all the harts.
Thus hetergenous hart systems will only see the common ISA extensions.

PATCH 6 improves the /proc/cpuinfo interface for the available ISA extensions
via /proc/cpuinfo.

Here is the example output of /proc/cpuinfo:
(with debug patches in Qemu and Linux kernel)

/ # cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor	: 0
hart		: 0
isa		: rv64imafdcsu
isa-ext		: sstc,sscofpmf
mmu		: sv48

processor	: 1
hart		: 1
isa		: rv64imafdcsu
isa-ext		: sstc,sscofpmf
mmu		: sv48

processor	: 2
hart		: 2
isa		: rv64imafdcsu
isa-ext		: sstc,sscofpmf
mmu		: sv48

processor	: 3
hart		: 3
isa		: rv64imafdcsu
isa-ext		: sstc,sscofpmf
mmu		: sv48

Anybody adding support for any new multi-letter extensions should add an
entry to the riscv_isa_ext_id and the isa extension array. 
E.g. The patch[2] adds the support for sstc extension.

Changes from v1->v2:
1. Instead of adding a separate DT property use the riscv,isa property.
2. Based on Tsukasa's v3 isa extension improvement series.
